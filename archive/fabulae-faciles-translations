	== Ritchie's Fabulae Faciles

       	=== The Ark
	These (things) are being told narrated about Perseus by the poets. Perseus was the son of Jupiter, great among the gods; the grandfather of his was called Acrisius. Acrisius was willing to kill his grandson Perseus; for he was fearing the boy on account of the oracle. Then he even seized the infant Perseus, and with (his) mother enclosed in a wooden box. Then he will throw the very box in the sea. Danae, the mother of Perseus, was exceedingly afraid; for the great sea was troubling the weather. However, Perseus was sleeping in the lap of (his) mother.
