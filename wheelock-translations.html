<h3>Pandora's Box</h3>
<p>Iapetus has 2 sons, Prometheus and Epimetheus. Prometheus is a man of wisdom; Epimetheus is a man without wisdom. Jupiter gives a pretty woman, Pandora, to Epimetheus. Prometheus often warns Epimetheus about Pandora : &ldquo;Epimetheus, you err! You do not see the danger. You ought not to accept the woman&rdquo;. Epimetheus loves Pandora; he does not think about the danger. Jupiter gives a box to Epimetheus; he is not permitted to open the box. But Pandora is curious: &ldquo;What is in the box? Lot of money? Large number of gems?&rdquo; The woman opens the box. Many forms of bad (things) fly out and wander. But Pandora conserves hope in the box. Even if life is full of bad things, we always have hope.	</p>
<h3>The Tragic Story of Phaethon</h3>
<p>Phaethon is the son of Phoebus (sun god). A friend of Phaethon doubts about the fame of (his) divine origin. &ldquo;You are not the son of god. You do not have the gift of the gods. Your story is not true.&rdquo; Huge anger moves Phaethon: &ldquo;I am the son of the god! Phoebus, give the proof!&rdquo; says Phaethon. Phoebus listens to the boy and without delay, flies down from the sky. &ldquo;My son, what do you desire?&rdquo; Phoebus inquires. &ldquo;Money? Wisdom? A life without troubles?&rdquo; Phaethon answers, &ldquo;I desire to have the reigns and to drive the sun chariot.&rdquo; Stupid boy! Your plan is bad. You ought not to desire the office of the gods. Phoebus warns (his) son, but the boy does not see the great dangers. The horses are strong; Phaethon is not strong. The chariot is moving without the real magister in the sky. What do we see? Phaethon falls from the sky. Bad fortune!</p>
<h3>The Adventures of Io</h3>
<p>Jupiter, the king of gods, used to love the beautiful Io (a Greek maiden), but he used to fear the anger of Juno (Jupiter's wife). Therefore he changed the form of Io : &ldquo;Juno will not see a woman but a cow,&rdquo; Jupiter was thinking. Juno was not stupid, &ldquo;Do you have a gift for me, husband? Will you give a pretty cow to Juno? Give, if you love me!&rdquo;. Therefore, Jupiter gave the cow to Juno. A big guard, Argus used to stay behind with the cow. Argus used to have 100 eyes. Mercury overcame Argus, but Io was not yet free: bad gadfly was remaining with the cow. Io was wandering across the land; many people were watching but (she) was not having (her) own true form. The unfortunate woman! Will you have the form of the cow always? Is not your punishment enough?</p>
<p>The anger of Juno was not perpetual: Jupiter gave the human form to Io; then Io gave birth to a son. You all will see the 100 eyes of Argus in the tail of the peacock.</p>
<h3>The Curse of Atreus</h3>
<p>The sons of Pelops were Atreus and Thyestes. Thyestes seduced the wife of Atreus; then Atreus discovers the fault and is not able to tolerate. Therefore, he thinks plots against (his) brother. &ldquo;I am full of anger! Hence, I will kill and cut up the small sons of my brother. Then I will cook the limbs and give the meal to Thyestes.&rdquo; He kills the boys; Thyestes sees his own dead sons on the table. Poor Thyestes! Now you have nothing. But, Atreus, because of your big faults, your sons will give many punishments. In the spirit of your sons, will remain your ancient crime; it will be forever. What should we think about your plans, Atreus? You were not able to overcome your anger; thus your fame will always be bad. Few good (men) will praise, but many (men) will blame you and your life.</p>
<h3>Cleobis and Biton</h3>
<p>Cleobis and Biton were sons of Cydippe. Cydippe was the priestess of the goddess Juno. Cydippe desired to see the big statue of Juno. But, the statue was far away and Cydippe was not able to walk; the boys did not have oxen. Cleobis and Biton loved Cydippe; therefore they themselves pulled a wagon. The labour was difficult, but the sons of Cydippe were strong. Now Cydippe was able to see the statue; then she prayed to Juno: &ldquo;O beautiful goddess! Cleobis and Biton have good principles and virtue. Give my sons the best award.&rdquo; On account of the prayers of Cydippe, Juno gave to the boys a death without delay and pain. Now Cleobis and Biton are happy with peace forever.	</p>
<h3>Laocoön and the Trojan Horse</h3>
<p>The Greeks were waging a war with the Trojans. They leave behind a wooden horse under the gates of the city Troy. The Trojans discover the horse there. They say, &ldquo;the Greeks dedicate the horse to Minerva.&rdquo; &ldquo;If we lead the gift of the Greeks to the temple of the goddess, we will have peace and will live the life of good fortune.&rdquo; But Laocoön, a priest of great virtue and wisdom dares to warn the people: &ldquo;Trojans, you all think without reason! If the troops are in the horse, we will wander into great danger. You all ought never to believe the Greeks for the Greeks are always deceitful.&rdquo; Then he strike the horse with a spear. The anger of Minerva is great; the goddess sends two snakes out of the sea. Poor Laocoön! The bad snakes strangle you and your sons! The Trojans fear the goddess; they lead the horse into the city. The reason of Laocoön teaches the Trojans nothing.</p>
<h3>Nisus and Euryalus</h3>
<p>Aeneas was leading the Trojans against the Rutulians. When it was night and the troops were sleeping, the leaders of the Trojans were considering a plan the camps. Nisus and Euryalus, young Trojans, dare to come to these (men). &ldquo;O great men&rdquo;, says Nisus, &ldquo;if you send me with Euryalus to the camp of the Rutulians, we will not only kill many men but we will also snatch much loot from those men; sleep truly has those men.&rdquo; &ldquo;I praise praise the spirits and virtue of these young men!&rdquo; exclaims Iulus, the son of that Aeneas. "Bye!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Now Nisus and Euryalus come into the camp of the Rutulians. They kill one man, then many other men. Euryalus snatches the decoration of one, helmet of another. They flee with this loot. But Volens, the leader of the Rutulians sees those Trojans and calls other Rutulians. The shine of the helmet guides the men towards Euryalus. Nisus sees this man in danger and dares to save (his) freind. He kills Volens, but before, that man kills Euryalus. Then other (men) conquer Nisus; he falls over the body of Euyalus.</p>
<p>Vergil write this full story and will give eternal fame to these Trojans.</p>
<h3>Aurora and Tithonus</h3>
<p>Goddess Aurora was loving Tithonus (a Trojan Prince), a handsome man. Therefore she goes to Jupiter: &ldquo;O king of gods,&rdquo; she says, &ldquo;listen to me! My Tithonus is not a god; after few years he will go towards old age. If you give him eternal life, I will always praise you.&rdquo; Stupid Aurora! You do jot see the big danger of that gift. Jupiter gives immortality to Tithonus, but that man grows old while he lives. Time flies, now Aurora is beautiful, Tithonus is not handsome. The body is no longer healthy, it is wrinkled and bent; wisdom does not stay in the mind. What will Aurora do? Will she be able to restore the form for Tithonus. She thinks and makes a plan: &ldquo; O Tithonus, my love! I will change you into a grasshopper, then you will be able to babbles without guilt. You will live in this cage and I will always love you.&rdquo;</p>
<h3>Ulysses and the Cyclops</h3>
<p>After the Trojan war, Ulysses comes towards the land of Cyclops with 12 men. They discover good cheese in a cave. While they eat it, Cyclops Polyphemus leads large sheep into the same cave and sees the Greeks: &ldquo;What are you all doing in my cave? You all will give penalties if you all have bad plans in mind.&rdquo; &ldquo;We all sail from Troy,&rdquo; Ulysses says to him. &ldquo;What will you give to us?&rdquo; However, Polyphemus exclaims: &ldquo;Stupid! What will you, you and you beloved, give to me?&rdquo; Without delay he seizes and eats few men! He then enquires, &ldquo;what is the name for you?&rdquo; Ulysses responds. &ldquo;No one.&rdquo; While sleep overcomes Polyphemus, the Greeks make plots. They sharpen a log in a flame and send it into the eye. Oh poor Polyphemus! Things do not go well for you. Other Cyclops come, but they do not perceive the true danger: &ldquo;No one harms me!&rdquo; Polyphemus says. &ldquo;Good&rdquo;, they say. &ldquo;Bye!&rdquo; Therefore the Greeks are able to flee out of the cave. The blind Cyclops hears those words: &ldquo;Bye! I am not no one, but I am Ulysses!&rdquo;</p>
<h3>A Gift Bearing Greeks</h3>
<p>In Asia was the great city, troy. There, king Priam was residing. Paris, his son had captured Helena, a beautiful Greek woman. Because of this crime, many Greeks had come towards Asia and for a long time had waged a violent war with the Trojans. However, they had not been able to overcome the walls of the city. But then Epeus, one of the Greeks, had given the advise to them: &ldquo;If we will make a big wooden horse and give to the Trojans, we will be able to conquer them; for we will have concealed the Greeks in the horse.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You had instructed us well,&rdquo; the Greeks had said and they had made that artifice without any delay. After the war, Aeneas, the Trojan leader, had said, &ldquo;we had not seen the troops in the horse; we had led it into the city. Therefore the Greeks had been able to conquer us. The gods had perceived the bad luck beforehand and had fled out of the city.&rdquo; </p>
