	I took Latin 101 at UofI (Spring 2017).
	Then in Summer 2017, I started reading 38 Latin Stories which is an accompaniment to Wheelock's Latin. I intend to document my translations [wheelock-translations.html here] for future reference. 
	- I realise my translations may not make the best of the English sentences to read, but my aim is to ensure that the Latin translations are accurate.

	Okay, so, this book got really hard by the time I reached story \#13. I will come back to this once I study more Latin grammar. For now I will be reading Ritchie's /Fabulae Faciles/.
