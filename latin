	== 38 Latin Stories
	In Summer 2017, I started reading 38 Latin Stories which is an accompaniment to Wheelock's Latin. I intend to document my translations here for future reference. 
	- I took Latin 101 at UIUC (Spring 2017).
	- I realise my translations may not make the best of the English sentences to read, but my aim is to ensure that the Latin translations are accurate.

       	=== Pandora's Box
	Iapetus has 2 sons, Prometheus and Epimetheus. Prometheus is a man of wisdom; Epimetheus is a man without wisdom. Jupiter gives a pretty woman, Pandora, to Epimetheus. Prometheus often warns Epimetheus about Pandora : "Epimetheus, you err! You do not see the danger. You ought not to accept the woman". Epimetheus loves Pandora; he does not think about the danger. Jupiter gives a box to Epimetheus; he is not permitted to open the box. But Pandora is curious: "What is in the box? Lot of money? Large number of gems?" The woman opens the box. Many forms of bad (things) fly out and wander. But Pandora conserves hope in the box. Even if life is full of bad things, we always have hope.	

	=== The Tragic Story of Phaethon
	Phaethon is the son of Phoebus (sun god). A friend of Phaethon doubts about the fame of (his) divine origin. "You are not the son of god. You do not have the gift of the gods. Your story is not true." Huge anger moves Phaethon: "I am the son of the god! Phoebus, give the proof!" says Phaethon. Phoebus listens to the boy and without delay, flies down from the sky. "My son, what do you desire?" Phoebus inquires. "Money? Wisdom? A life without troubles?" Phaethon answers, "I desire to have the reigns and to drive the sun chariot." Stupid boy! Your plan is bad. You ought not to desire the office of the gods. Phoebus warns (his) son, but the boy does not see the great dangers. The horses are strong; Phaethon is not strong. The chariot is moving without the real magister in the sky. What do we see? Phaethon falls from the sky. Bad fortune!
	
	=== The Adventures of Io
	Jupiter, the king of gods, used to love the beautiful Io (a Greek maiden), but he used to fear the anger of Juno (Jupiter's wife). Therefore he changed the form of Io : "Juno will not see a woman but a cow," Jupiter was thinking. Juno was not stupid, "Do you have a gift for me, husband? Will you give a pretty cow to Juno? Give, if you love me!". Therefore, Jupiter gave the cow to Juno. A big guard, Argus used to stay behind with the cow. Argus used to have 100 eyes. Mercury overcame Argus, but Io was not yet free: bad gadfly was remaining with the cow. Io was wandering across the land; many people were watching but (she) was not having (her) own true form. The unfortunate woman! Will you have the form of the cow always? Is not your punishment enough?
	
	The anger of Juno was not perpetual: Jupiter gave the human form to Io; then Io gave birth to a son. You all will see the 100 eyes of Argus in the tail of the peacock.
