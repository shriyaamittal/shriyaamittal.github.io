	== 38 Latin Stories
	In Summer 2017, I started reading 38 Latin Stories which is an accompaniment to Wheelock's Latin. I intend to document my translations here for future reference. 

       	=== Pandora's Box
	Iapetus has 2 sons, Prometheus and Epimetheus. Prometheus is a man of wisdom; Epimetheus is a man without wisdom. Jupiter gives a pretty woman, Pandora, to Epimetheus. Prometheus often warns Epimetheus about Pandora : "Epimetheus, you err! You do not see the danger. You ought not to accept the woman". Epimetheus loves Pandora; he does not think about the danger. Jupiter gives a box to Epimetheus; he is not permitted to open the box. But Pandora is curious: "What is in the box? Lot of money? Large number of gems?" The woman opens the box. Many forms of bad (things) fly out and wander. But Pandora conserves hope in the box. Even if life is full of bad things, we always have hope.
