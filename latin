	== 38 Latin Stories
	In Summer 2017, I started reading 38 Latin Stories which is an accompaniment to Wheelock's Latin. I intend to document my translations [wheelock-translations.html here] for future reference. 
	- I took Latin 101 at UIUC (Spring 2017).
	- I realise my translations may not make the best of the English sentences to read, but my aim is to ensure that the Latin translations are accurate.
