	<h1>Latin and Me!</h1>
        Well, I guess I only wanted to jot down some of my experiences/epiphanies as I learn the <i>lingua Latina</i>. 
	And, BTW, some of these may be post-dated, or not written in full sentences. 
	They are only passing thoughts in my brain. I am also typing them either in vim or on Github directly. Hence, no spellcheck :(<br>

	Latin, nice. <br>
	Isn't Latin ... a dead language? <br>
	Who are you going to talk to, the Pope? <br>
	<br>
	These are some of the reactions I have received when I told people I am taking a Latin class. Not that I have told many people, but people who need to know, know. 
	I have also wondered why I actually learnt the language? I have tried to come up with many explanations. And since there is no one reason, I must have answered differently every time I was asked the question. 
	<br> <br>
	Now, that I have finished the Latin 101 course (at UIUC), and expect to get an A+ (yay!), I am reading 38 Latin stories which is a supplementary reader to Wheelock's Latin textbook. I might post my translations on this page. Umm ... not so sure yet!
	<br> <br>
	Also, we followed Susan Shelmerdine's textbook Introduction to Latin in our class. My biggest qualm about it was that the answers to the exercises in the textbook were not available. So if anyone has found a link, please do let me know. I intend to study Chapter 14 onwards myself, not as part of a class and so I won't have an instructor to trouble with my doubts during office hours. Email me at smittal6 [at] illinois [dot] edu
