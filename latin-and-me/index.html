	<h1>Latin and Me!</h1>
        Well, I guess I only wanted to jot down some of my experiences/epiphanies as I learn the <i>lingua Latina</i>. 
	And, BTW, some of these may be post-dated, or not written in full sentences. 
	They are only passing thoughts in my brain. I am also typing them either in vim or on Github directly. Hence, no spellcheck :(<br>

        <h3><u>May 15, 2017</u></h3>  
	Latin, nice. <br>
	Isn't Latin ... a dead language? <br>
	Who are you going to talk to, the Pope? <br>
	These are some of the reactions I have received when I told people I am taking a Latin class. Not that I have told many people, but people who need to know, know. 
	I have also wondered why I actually learnt the language? I have tried to come up with many explanations. And since there is no one reason, I must have answered differently every time I was asked the question. Now, that I have finished the Latin 101 course (at UIUC), and expect to get an A+ (yay!), I have lot more thoughts on it than before I started learning the language.
