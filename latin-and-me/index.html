	<h1>Latin and Me!</h1>
        Well, I guess I only wanted to jot down some of my experiences/epiphanies as I learn the <i>lingua Latina</i>. 
	And, BTW, some of these may be post-dated, or not written in full sentences. 
	They are only passing thoughts in my brain. I am also typing them either in vim or on Github directly. Hence, no spellcheck :(<br>

	Latin, nice! Isn't it a dead language? Who are you going to talk to, the Pope? <br>
